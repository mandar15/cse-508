// TODO

1. Timing according to algo.
2. Appending junk data ( packet_send_ignore(len) )
3. Write at most {MAX_MSS} bytes. <- process_output modification. FIXME:// output_drain does not follow the conventions of fixed packet length.
4. Stop on idle. State machine implementation as discussed.
5. 2^k - constant sized packets in a session.
